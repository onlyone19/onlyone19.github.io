## Choices

### [509. (E) Fibnacci Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/fibonacci-number/description/)
The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,

F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1.

Given n, calculate F(n).


### [70. (E) Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/description/)
You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?


### [746. (E) Minimum Cost Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-cost-climbing-stairs/description/)
You are given an integer array cost where cost[i] is the cost of ith step on a staircase. Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps.

You can either start from the step with index 0, or the step with index 1.

Return the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor.


### [983. (M) Min Cost of Tickets](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-for-tickets/description/)
You have planned some train traveling one year in advance. The days of the year in which you will travel are given as an integer array days. Each day is an integer from 1 to 365.

Train tickets are sold in three different ways:

    a 1-day pass is sold for costs[0] dollars,
    a 7-day pass is sold for costs[1] dollars, and
    a 30-day pass is sold for costs[2] dollars.

The passes allow that many days of consecutive travel.

    For example, if we get a 7-day pass on day 2, then we can travel for 7 days: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

Return the minimum number of dollars you need to travel every day in the given list of days.

### [91. (M) Decode Ways](https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-ways/description/)

### [639. (M) Decode Ways II](https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-ways-ii/description/)

### [264. (M) Ugly Number II](https://leetcode.com/problems/ugly-number-ii/description/)
An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.

Given an integer n, return the nth ugly number.


### [32. (H) Longest Valid Parenthese](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-valid-parentheses/description/)
Given a string containing just the characters '(' and ')', return the length of the longest valid (well-formed) parentheses
substring


### [198. (M) House Robber](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/description/)

### [213. (M) House Robber II](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-ii/description/)



## States

### 256. Paint House


### 1289. Minimum Falling Path Sum II

### N个房子， 涂白色或黑色的花费分别是A和B。要求不能连续3间涂同一颜色。 求最小花费。

### 376. Wiggle Subsequence


### 121. (E) Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock



## Cuts
### [139. (M) Word Break](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-break/description/)
Given a string s and a dictionary of strings wordDict, return true if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

Note that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.


### [140. (H) Word Break II](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-break-ii/description/)
Given a string s and a dictionary of strings wordDict, add spaces in s to construct a sentence where each word is a valid dictionary word. Return all such possible sentences in any order.

Note that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.

### Game of 5 Powers
You are give a string 'S' that consits of characters '0' and '1' only. Return the smallest positive integer `K` such that it is possible to cut `S` into `K` pieces, 
each of them being a power of 5 (no leading zeros). If there is no such `K`, return `-1` instead.

e.g. S = "101101101" return 3 (101 is 5)

e.g. S = "1111101" return 1 (1111101 is 125)

e.g. S = "0000" return -1

e.g. S = "100" return -1

## Other

### [467. (M) Unique Substrings in wrapped around String](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-substrings-in-wraparound-string/)
We define the string base to be the infinite wraparound string of "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz", so base will look like this:

- "...zabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcd....".

Given a string s, return the number of unique non-empty substrings of s are present in base.


### [940. (H) Distinct Subsequences II](https://leetcode.com/problems/distinct-subsequences-ii/description/)
Given a string s, return the number of distinct non-empty subsequences of s. Since the answer may be very large, 
return it modulo 109 + 7.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not.
