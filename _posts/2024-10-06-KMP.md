## KMP
KMP算法详解
- 理解next数组的定义，定义是一切的关键，`前缀和后缀的最大匹配长度`
- 假设已经有了next数组，详解匹配过程是如何得到加速的，`加速过程有2个理解核心`
- 理解了匹配主流程之后，详解next数组如何快速生成，`不停跳跃的过程有1个理解核心`
- KMP算法代码详解，主流程 + next数组生成
- 时间复杂度O(n)的证明，直接从代码层次就可以分析出来，分析方式好理解，但是比较特别

以后可以认为，求解1个位置的next数组的值，时间复杂度O(1)

```java
// KMP算法
public static int kmp(char[] s1, char[] s2) {
  // s1中当前比对的位置是x
  // s2中当前比对的位置是y
  int n = s1.length, m = s2.length, x = 0, y = 0;
  // O(m)
  int[] next = nextArray(s2, m);
  // O(n)
  while (x < n && y < m) {
    if (s1[x] == s2[y]) {
      x++;
      y++;
    } else if (y == 0) {
      x++;
    } else {
      y = next[y];
    }
  }
  return y == m ? x - y : -1;
}

// 得到next数组
public static int[] nextArray(char[] s, int m) {
  if (m == 1) {
    return new int[] { -1 };
  }
  int[] next = new int[m];
  next[0] = -1;
  next[1] = 0;
  // i表示当前要求next值的位置
  // cn表示当前要和前一个字符比对的下标
  int i = 2, cn = 0;
  while (i < m) {
    if (s[i - 1] == s[cn]) {
      next[i++] = ++cn;
    } else if (cn > 0) {
      cn = next[cn];
    } else {
      next[i++] = 0;
    }
  }
  return next;
}

### [572. Subtree of Another Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/subtree-of-another-tree/description/)
```
Given the roots of two binary trees root and subRoot, return true if there is a subtree of root with the same structure and node values of subRoot and false otherwise.

A subtree of a binary tree tree is a tree that consists of a node in tree and all of this node's descendants. The tree tree could also be considered as a subtree of itself.

### [P4391 [BOI2009] Radio Transmission 无线传输 ]( https://www.luogu.com.cn/problem/P4391)
```
给你一个字符串 s1，它是由某个字符串 s2​ 不断自我连接形成的（保证至少重复 2 次）。但是字符串 s2​ 是不确定的，现在只想知道它的最短长度是多少。

```


### [Censoring S](https://www.luogu.com.cn/problem/P4824)
```
Farmer John has purchased a subscription to Good Hooveskeeping magazine for his cows, so they have plenty of material to read while waiting around in the barn
during milking sessions. Unfortunately, the latest issue contains a rather inappropriate article on how to cook the perfect steak, which FJ would rather his cows
not see (clearly, the magazine is in need of better editorial oversight).

FJ has taken all of the text from the magazine to create the string SS of length at most 10^6 characters. From this, he would like to remove occurrences of a
substring TT to censor the inappropriate content. To do this, Farmer John finds the first occurrence of TT in SS and deletes it. He then repeats the process
again, deleting the first occurrence of TT again, continuing until there are no more occurrences of TT in SS. Note that the deletion of one occurrence might
create a new occurrence of TT that didn't exist before.

Please help FJ determine the final contents of SS after censoring is complete.

### [1367. Linked List in Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-in-binary-tree/description/)
```
Given a binary tree root and a linked list with head as the first node. 

Return True if all the elements in the linked list starting from the head correspond to some downward path connected in the binary tree otherwise return False.

In this context downward path means a path that starts at some node and goes downwards.

```


### [1397. (H) Find All Good Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-good-strings/description/)
```
Given the strings s1 and s2 of size n and the string evil, return the number of good strings.

A good string has size n, it is alphabetically greater than or equal to s1, it is alphabetically smaller than or equal to s2, and it does not contain the string evil as a substring.
Since the answer can be a huge number, return this modulo 10^9 + 7.
