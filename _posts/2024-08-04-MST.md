### [1168. (H) optimize water distribution in a village](https://leetcode.com/problems/optimize-water-distribution-in-a-village)
idea: treat water source as a virtual node, then find minimum spanging true
```
There are n houses in a village. We want to supply water for all the houses by building wells and laying pipes.

For each house i, we can either build a well inside it directly with cost wells[i], or pipe in water from another well to it. The costs to lay pipes between houses are given by the array pipes, where each pipes[i] = [house1, house2, cost] represents the cost to connect house1 and house2 together using a pipe. Connections are bidirectional.

Find the minimum total cost to supply water to all houses.

Example 1:

Input: n = 3, wells = [1,2,2], pipes = [[1,2,1],[2,3,1]]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
The image shows the costs of connecting houses using pipes.
The best strategy is to build a well in the first house with cost 1 and connect the other houses to it with cost 2 so the total cost is 3.

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 10000
wells.length == n
0 <= wells[i] <= 10^5
1 <= pipes.length <= 10000
1 <= pipes[i][0], pipes[i][1] <= n
0 <= pipes[i][2] <= 10^5
pipes[i][0] != pipes[i][1]
```


### [1697. (H) checking existance of edge length limited paths](https://leetcode.com/problems/checking-existence-of-edge-length-limited-paths/)
```
An undirected graph of n nodes is defined by edgeList, where edgeList[i] = [ui, vi, disi] denotes an edge between nodes ui and vi with distance disi. Note that there may be multiple edges between two nodes.

Given an array queries, where queries[j] = [pj, qj, limitj], your task is to determine for each queries[j] whether there is a path between pj and qj such that each edge on the path has a distance strictly less than limitj .

Return a boolean array answer, where answer.length == queries.length and the jth value of answer is true if there is a path for queries[j] is true, and false otherwise.
