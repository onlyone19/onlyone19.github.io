### Digit DP


### [357. (M) Count Numbers with Unique Digits](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-numbers-with-unique-digits/description/)
Given an integer n, return the count of all numbers with unique digits, x, where 0 <= x < 10<sup>n</sup>.


### [902. (H) Numbers At Most N Given Digit Set](https://leetcode.com/problems/numbers-at-most-n-given-digit-set/description/)
Given an array of digits which is sorted in non-decreasing order. You can write numbers using each digits[i] as many times as we want. For example, 
if digits = ['1','3','5'], we may write numbers such as '13', '551', and '1351315'.

Return the number of positive integers that can be generated that are less than or equal to a given integer n.


### [2719. (H) Count of Integers](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-of-integers/description/)
You are given two numeric strings num1 and num2 and two integers max_sum and min_sum. We denote an integer x to be good if:
  - num1 <= x <= num2
  - min_sum <= digit_sum(x) <= max_sum.
Return the number of good integers. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

Note that digit_sum(x) denotes the sum of the digits of x.

### [2376. (H) Count Special Integers](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-special-integers/description/)
We call a positive integer special if all of its digits are distinct.

Given a positive integer n, return the number of special integers that belong to the interval [1, n].

### [1012. (H) Numbers With Repeated Digits](https://leetcode.com/problems/numbers-with-repeated-digits/description/)
Given an integer n, return the number of positive integers in the range [1, n] that have at least one repeated digit.

### [600. (H) Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones](https://leetcode.com/problems/non-negative-integers-without-consecutive-ones/description/)
Given a positive integer n, return the number of the integers in the range [0, n] whose binary representations do not contain consecutive ones.

### [1067. (H) Digit Count in Range](https://leetcode.com/problems/digit-count-in-range/description/)
Given a single-digit integer d and two integers low and high, you need to compute how often the digit d appears within the range of numbers 
from low to high inclusively. It involves counting occurrences of d in each number and summing them up for that entire range. For instance, 
if d is 3 and the range is from 10 to 13, then d appears 2 times (once in "13" and once in "3").

### [233. (H)Number of Digit One](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-digit-one/description/)
Given an integer n, count the total number of digit 1 appearing in all non-negative integers less than or equal to n.

### [P2657 [SCOI2009] windy 数 ](https://www.luogu.com.cn/problem/P2657)
不含前导零且相邻两个数字之差至少为 2的正整数被称为 windy 数。windy 想知道，在 a 和 b 之间，包括 a 和 b ，总共有多少个 windy 数？

### [P3413 SAC#1 - 萌数 ](https://www.luogu.com.cn/problem/P3413)
满足“存在长度至少为 2 的回文子串”的数是萌的——也就是说，101 是萌的，因为 101 本身就是一个回文数；110是萌的，因为包含回文子串 11；但是 102 不是萌的，1201 也不是萌的。

现在 SOL 想知道从 l 到 r 的所有整数中有多少个萌数。

由于答案可能很大，所以只需要输出答案对 1000000007（109+7）的余数。

说明/提示

记 n 为 r 在 10 进制下的位数。 n ≤ 1000，l < r



### [788. (M) Rotated Digits](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotated-digits/description/)
An integer x is a **good** if after rotating each digit individually by 180 degrees, we get a valid number that is different from x. Each digit must be rotated - we cannot choose to leave it alone.

A number is valid if each digit remains a digit after rotation. For example:

  - 0, 1, and 8 rotate to themselves,
  - 2 and 5 rotate to each other (in this case they are rotated in a different direction, in other words, 2 or 5 gets mirrored),
  - 6 and 9 rotate to each other, and
  - the rest of the numbers do not rotate to any other number and become invalid.

Given an integer n, return the number of **good** integers in the range [1, n].
