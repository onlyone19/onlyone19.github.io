## Step 0: Prerequisites 
- IDE: Eclipse 202003
- AdoptOpenJDK: jdk-11.0.7.10-hotspot installed with JAVA_HOME configured appropriately
- Apache Maven 3.6.2+

Verify Maven is using the Java you expect
If you have multiple JDK’s installed it is not certain Maven will pick up the expected java and you could end up 
with unexpected results. You can verify which JDK Maven uses by running <code>mvn --version.</code>

### Step 1: Bootstrapping the project
```
mvn io.quarkus:quarkus-maven-plugin:1.4.2.Final:create 
-DprojectGroupId=org.acme 
-DprojectArtifactId=getting-started 
-DclassName="org.acme.getting.started.GreetingResource" 
-Dpath="/hello"
cd getting-started
```

The following table lists the attributes you can pass to the create command:
| Attribute  |	Default Value |	Description |
| ---------  | -------------- | --------- |
| projectGroupId | org.acme.sample | The group id of the created project |
| projectArtifactId | mandatory | The artifact id of the created project. Not passing it triggers the interactive mode. |
| projectVersion | 1.0-SNAPSHOT | The version of the created project |
| platformGroupId | io.quarkus | The group id of the target platform. Given that all the existing platforms are coming from io.quarkus this one won’t practically be used explicitly. But it’s still an option.|
| platformArtifactId | quarkus-universe-bom | The artifact id of the target platform BOM. It should be quarkus-bom in order to use the locally built Quarkus. |
| platformVersion | If it’s not specified, the latest one will be resolved. | The version of the platform you want the project to use. It can also accept a version range, in which case the latest from the specified range will be used. |
| className | Not created if omitted | The fully qualified name of the generated resource |
| path | /hello | The resource path, only relevant if className is set. |
| extensions | [] | The list of extensions to add to the project (comma-separated) |
