## What is a stash? 
This functionality is useful when you’ve made changes to a branch that you aren’t ready to commit to, but you need to switch to another branch without losing those changes.

While git stash isn't exactly a common command, it can be a useful tool for making meaningful commits. Keep this in mind the next time you wish you could put something on hold and return to it later.



## Stashing changes 
To save your changes in the stash, you can use:
```
git stash
```
or 
```
git stash save "optional message for yourself"
```

By default, running `git stash` will stash:

    - changes that have been added to your index (staged changes)
    - changes made to files that are currently tracked by Git (unstaged changes)

But it will not stash:

    - new files in your working copy that have not yet been staged
    - files that have been ignored

  However, adding the `-u` option (or `--include-untracked`) tells `git stash` to also stash your untracked files, and you can include changes to ignored files as well by passing the `-a` option (or `--all`) when running `git stash`.


## View Stashed Changes 
```
$ git stash list
stash@{0}: On main: add style to our site
stash@{1}: WIP on main: 5002d47 our new homepage
stash@{2}: WIP on main: 5002d47 our new homepage
```

## Applying Stashed Changes 
To retrieve and apply the changes out of the stash to the current branch, there are two options:
```
git stash apply STASH-NAME
```
The above command applies the changes and leaves a copy in the stash. This is useful if you want to apply the same stashed changes to multiple branches.
```
git stash pop STASH-NAME
```
The above command applies the changes and removes the files from the stash.


## Delete Stashed Changes 
If you want to remove stashed changes without applying them, run the command:
```
git stash drop STASH-NAME
```
To clear the entire stash, run the command:
```
git stash clear
```
