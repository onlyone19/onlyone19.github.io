# A guide to developing a balanced list of 8-10 schools, plus how to decide whether or not to apply early
================================================
## Where do I start finding the right colleges?

Stay on www.collegexpress.com and type in the school name. Then click “Lists” to see what other lists that school is on. In fact, I’ve linked some of these lists directly at the bottom of this blog post. (Scroll down to see more.)

For the pro perspective, check out the Fiske Guide to Colleges, which is (ask any counselor) the go-to guide for college research.  It has great 2-3 page summaries of hundreds of colleges and is a great starting point. 

For the student perspective, go to unigo.com where you can read real students’ opinions on their schools. But don’t just read 1-2 reviews, read a bunch of them, in particular the “What’s the stereotype of students at your school?” and “Is the stereotype true?” You’ll get a sense of the school vibe pretty quick.

For virtual campus tours, check out CampusReel.org.  While there are tons of other virtual campus tour websites out there, most of them focus on what a campus looks like but precious few websites or tours really let you get a sense of what a college campus feels like.  
The tours on Campus Reel are led by real, current students, usually in selfie-mode on their phone, and you get to hear them share more about what they love (and don’t love) about their college, whether you’re following them on their way to class, in the dining hall, or at a get-together.

## Here are a few of my favorite tools for assessing your chances.

1. Mark Moody’s Quick and Dirty College List Builder is one of my favorite tools for helping students get a rough idea of their college admissions chances. 

2. Cappex provides a great tool that allows you to input your weighted and unweighted GPA, your test scores, and your college preferences, and it will match you with schools 

3. CollegeData, as its name suggest, has TONS of data on the average test scores, general acceptance rates, and average GPAs of incoming college freshman.
